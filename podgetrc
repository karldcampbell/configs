# Filename Cleanup: For FAT32 filename compatability (Feature Request #1378956)
# Tested with the following characters: !@#$%^&*()_-+=||{[}]:;"'<,>.?/

# Filename Replace Character: Character to use to replace any/all 
# bad characters found.

# When you run podget at a verbosity of 3 or 4, it may appear that the filename format fixes are done out of order.  That is because
# they are named as they are created and as new fixes have been developed, those with more detailed exclusionary conditions have had
# to be done before those with more generic conditions.  Looking for improvements to fix this issue.

# Filename Cleanup 2:  Some RSS Feeds (like the BBC World News Bulletin) 
# download files with names like filename.mp3?1234567.  Enable this mode 
# to fix the format to filename1234567.mp3.

# Filename Cleanup 3: Filenames of feeds hosted by LBC Plus corrupted.
# Fixed per MoonUnit's feature request (#1660764)
#
# Takes an URL that looks like:  http://lbc.audioagain.com/shared/audio/stream.mp3?guid=2007-03/14<...snip>
#                            <snip...>a7766e8ad2748269fd347eaee2b2e3f8&amp;source=podcast.php&amp;channel_id=88
#
# Which normally creates a file named: a7766e8ad2748269fd347eaee2b2e3f8&amp;source=podcast.php&amp;channel_id=88
#
# This fix extracts the date of the episode and changes the filename to 2007-03-14.mp3
# 0 == disabled
# 1 == enabled (default)

# Filename Cleanup 4: Filenames of feeds hosted by CatRadio.cat need fixing.
# Fixed per Oriol Rius's Bug Report (#1744705)
#
# Downloaded filenames look like: 1189153569775.mp3?programa=El+mat%ED+de+Catalunya+R%E0dio&amp;podcast=y 
# This fix removes everything after the .mp3

# Filename Cleanup 5:  When the filename is part of the URL and the actual filename stays the same for
# all items listed.
#
# Download URLs look like: http://feeds.theonion.com/~r/theonion/radionews/~5/213589629/podcast_redirect.mp3
# Where 213589629 is the unique filename.
#
# This filename change is disabled by default because it may cause unintended changes to the filename.

# Filename Cleanup 6: Remove "?referrer=rss" from the end of filenames as included in some feeds like 
# those from Vimcasts.org.  Setup to work for MP3, M4V, OGG and OGV files.
#
# Feed URLs: http://vimcasts.org/feeds/ogg
#            http://vimcasts.org/feeds/quicktime

# Filename Cleanup 7:  Removes the trailing part of the filename after the '?'.
# Fixed at the request of Joerg Schiermeier
#
# For dealing with enclosures like those formatted in the ZDF podcast.
# Feed URL: http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/podcast/1193018?view=podcast
# Example enclosure:

# Filename Cleanup 8: 
# This fix is for feeds that assign the same filename to be downloaded for each
# enclosure and then embedded the actual filename of the object to be saved in 
# the media_url= parameter.  This fix extracts that name and uses it for the 
# saved file.
# 
# 0 == disabled
# 1 == enabled (default)

# Filename Cleanup 9:
# This fix is for feeds like Smodcast.  It removes the "?client_id=<string>"
# from the end of each enclosure url in the feed.
#
# NOTE:  To fully fix the filenames on feeds like Smodcast, this fix should
# be used in conjunction with filename_formatfix4.  
#
# Example URL: http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62837276/stream.mp3?client_id=a427c512429c9c90e58de7955257879c

# Filename Cleanup 10:
#
# This is a fix for podcast feeds formatted like those for Audioboo.  Removes everything after the ?
# in the filename.  Attempted to make this fix generic enough to work with a variety of feeds of mp3, mp4,
# ogg and ogv files.
#
# Feed URL: http://audioboo.fm/users/39903/boos.rss
# Example URL: http://audioboo.fm/boos/1273271-mw-123-es-wird-fruhling.mp3?keyed=true&amp;source=rss
